Super Pi Power!

This is a perl cgi that is meant to run on the Raspberry Pi and turns gpio pins on and off to control relays attached to outlets. It does not use the bcm2835 perl library and is developed under nginx with perl-fcgi.
I use sudo and the following sudoers entry to allow the webserver to modify the gpio pins:
www-data        ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/bin/bash -c echo * > /sys/class/gpio/*

There are only two options that need to be set by the user:
$mode which sets the type or configuration of your relay
@outlets which is an array of pins that are attached to relays

The interface is a very basic html web page that should work with any device with a modernweb browser. 


See https://github.com/jjfalling/Super-Pi-Power/blob/master/screenshot1.png for a screenshot of the interface or http://youtu.be/PVTMCSnzGkk for a demo of it in action.
