Super Pi Power!

This is a perl cgi that is meant to run on the Raspberry Pi and turns gpio pins on and off to control relays attached to outlets. 
There are only two options that need to be set by the user, $mode which sets the type or configuration of your relay and @outlets which is an array of pins that are attached to relays.
